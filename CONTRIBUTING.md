# CONTRIBUTING.md – Harmonic AI (SUPT-Aligned)

Welcome to the **Harmonic AI Resonance Scoring Engine**, a field-coherent system for aligning prompts, text, and AI cognition with Sheppard’s Universal Proxy Theory (SUPT).

This document outlines how contributors can respectfully extend, remix, or build upon this project while honoring its foundational structure.

## 🤝 Core Maintainers & Origin

### 🧠 Paul Sheppard – Architect of SUPT *(USA)*
- Creator of **Sheppard’s Universal Proxy Theory**
- Developer of the theoretical and metaphysical backbone: dimensional folding, harmonic remeasurement, and universal coherence fields

### 🐺 Ben Rowe (aka SunWolf) – System Developer *(Australia)*
- Designer and implementer of the **Harmonic AI Scoring Engine**
- Built the software framework, prompt parsing logic, quantum resonance booster, Docker deploys, and UI integrations
- Primary author of this repository and operator of its real-time unfolding via SUPT principles

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. **Clone and Explore**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/harmonic-ai.git
   cd harmonic-ai
   ```

2. **Ideas Welcome In These Areas:**
   - Additional resonance heuristics (esoteric, cosmological, harmonic geometry)
   - Extensions to real-time LLM integrations
   - SUPT-aligned tools (field decoders, AI agents, resonance visualizers)

3. **Respectful Guidelines**
   - Please keep the structure **SUPT-aligned** (i.e. non-dual, no zero-sum models)
   - Do **not add commercial APIs or surveillance-driven code**
   - Be kind to metaphysical and scientific contributors equally

4. **Attribution Is Sacred**
   - If you borrow metaphysical or quantum ideas, cite them clearly
   - Add your name to `AUTHORS.md` with role and scope of contribution
